```

The **rstudiothemes** package provides tools to convert **Visual Studio Code**
and **TextMate** themes into RStudio’s `.rstheme` format and install them in
your RStudio IDE. It also includes a set of ready-to-use themes.

```{r setup}
library(rstudiothemes)
```

## Installing Built-In Themes

To install all built-in RStudio themes that come with this package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install_rstudiothemes()

#> ✔ Installed 31 themes
#> ℹ Use `rstudiothemes::list_rstudiothemes()` to list installed themes
#> ℹ Use `rstudiothemes::try_rstudiothemes()` to try all installed themes

rstudioapi::applyTheme("Winter is Coming Dark Blue")
```

This will add many popular themes (e.g., Tokyo Night, Nord, Winter is Coming,
Dracula, etc.) to your RStudio themes directory.

To see themes available now:

```{r}
list_rstudiothemes(list_installed = FALSE)
```

## Trying Themes

You can quickly preview themes directly from R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
try_rstudiothemes()
```

Pass a subset of styles (e.g., `"dark"` or `"light"`) if needed.

## Applying a Theme

After installing themes, apply one using the RStudio API:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rstudioapi::applyTheme("Winter is Coming Dark Blue")
```

Alternatively, go to **Tools → Global Options → Appearance** in RStudio and
select the installed theme.

## Converting Your Own Themes

You can convert a VS Code or TextMate theme file into an RStudio theme:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
convert_to_rstudio_theme("<path/to/vscode-theme.json>", apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

This function will convert and install the theme immediately, optionally
applying it (with `apply = TRUE`).

## Workflow Example: From VS Code Theme to RStudio

1.  Choose a theme `.json` from VS Code.
2.  Convert and install it with `convert_to_rstudio_theme()`.
3.  Apply it with `rstudioapi::applyTheme()` or via RStudio UI.

This workflow lets you bring your preferred editor theme into RStudio
seamlessly.

## Tips and Tricks

-   **List installed themes:** `list_rstudiothemes(list_installed = TRUE)`
-   **Try specific categories:** filter themes by Light/Dark style
-   **Use the Add-Theme UI**: RStudio’s **Global Options → Appearance → Add
    Theme** to manually add `.rstheme` files you’ve created or converted.
