Convert **Visual Studio Code** and **TextMate** themes into **RStudio** custom
themes.

This package provides tools to easily convert Visual Studio Code and TextMate
theme files (`.json` and `.tmTheme` formats) into RStudio-compatible `.rstheme`
files. RStudio has supported custom themes in `.rstheme` format since [version
1.2+](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio-theme-creation.html).

## Features

-   Convert Visual Studio Code and TextMate themes into RStudio `.rstheme`
    format.
-   Bidirectional conversion between Visual Studio Code and TextMate themes.
-   Organize and manage custom themes in a reproducible way.
-   Integrates with R tooling for easier installation and testing.
-   Includes ports of popular Visual Studio Code themes ready to use in RStudio.

## Built-in Themes

This package includes ports of several popular Visual Studio Code themes, ready
to use in RStudio. Simply use the `install_rstudiothemes()` function to install
them into your RStudio environment:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rstudiothemes::install_rstudiothemes()

#> ✔ Installed 31 themes
#> ℹ Use `rstudiothemes::list_rstudiothemes()` to list installed themes
#> ℹ Use `rstudiothemes::try_rstudiothemes()` to try all installed themes

rstudioapi::applyTheme("Winter is Coming Dark Blue")
```

![Screenshot of theme Winter is Coming Dark
Blue](man/figures/winteriscoming.png)

Available themes include popular choices such as Tokyo Night, Night Owl, Winter
is Coming, SynthWave 84, Nord, and many others:

```{r}
rstudiothemes::list_rstudiothemes(list_installed = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install **rstudiothemes** using either of these methods:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dieghernan/rstudiothemes")
```

Or, install it from r-universe:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install rstudiothemes in R:
install.packages(
  "rstudiothemes",
  repos = c(
    "https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Migrating an existing theme

You can convert any Visual Studio Code or TextMate theme to RStudio format.
Here's how:

1.  Use your favorite Visual Studio Code or TextMate theme file or the URL of an
    online theme.
2.  Use the `convert_to_rstudio_theme()` function to convert and install it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rstudiothemes::convert_to_rstudio_theme("<path/to/file>", apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, install the `.rstheme` file via the RStudio UI:

*Tools \> Global Options \> Appearance \> Add Theme*

### Bidirectional conversion Visual Studio Code - TextMate

The package also includes the conversion functions `convert_vs_to_tm_theme()`
and `convert_tm_to_vs_theme()`, allowing you to convert themes in both
directions if needed.

## Creating themes from scratch

**rstudiothemes** does not provide a built-in theme editor, but you can create
your own themes from scratch using the following tools:

-   TextMate `*tmTheme`: <https://tmtheme-editor.linuxbox.ninja/>. Also see the
    official RStudio documentation on [creating
    themes](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio-theme-creation.html).
-   Visual Studio Code `*json`: See the official documentation on [creating
    color
    themes](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme).
